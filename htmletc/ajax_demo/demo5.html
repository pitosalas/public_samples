  <h2 class="title">The Road Not Taken</h2>
  <div class="stanza" id="first">
    <div class="line">Two roads diverged in a yellow wood</div>
    <div class="line">And sorry I could not travel both</div>
    <div class="line">And be one traveler, long I stood</div>
    <div class="line">And looked down one as far as I could</div>
    <div class="line">To where it bent in the undergrowth;</div>
  </div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="line">Then took the other, as just as fair,</div>
    <div class="line">And having perhaps the better claim</div>
    <div class="line">Because it was grassy and wanted wear,</div>
    <div class="line">Though as for that the passing there</div>
    <div class="line">Had worn them really about the same,</div>
  </div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="line">And both that morning equally lay</div>
    <div class="line">In leaves no step had trodden black.</div>
    <div class="line">Oh, I kept the first for another day!</div>
    <div class="line">Yet knowing how way leads on to way</div>
    <div class="line">I doubted if I should ever come back.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="line">I shall be telling this with a sigh</div>
    <div class="line">Somewhere ages and ages hence:</div>
    <div class="line">Two roads diverged in a wood, and I,</div>
    <div class="line">I took the one less traveled by,</div>
    <div class="line">And that has made all the difference.</div>
